Automatically recognize and decode/decrypt common encoding and encryption techniques.

[Ciphey](https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey) is designed to automatically recognize and decode/decrypt common encoding and encryption techniques. It was created by Brandon Skerritt and is licensed under MIT License. According the author, the tool uses "natural language processing & artifical intelligence, along with some common sense."

To run Ciphey using this Docker container, create a directory where you'll store your input files, e.g. ~/workdir/input.txt. Then, use a command like this to run "ciphey" and have your directory mapped as /home/nonroot/workdir inside the container:

```
docker run -it --rm -v ~/workdir:/home/nonroot/workdir cyware/ciphey -f input.txt 
```

Or for a text input:

```
docker run -it --rm cyware/ciphey "=MXazlHbh5WQgUmchdHbh1EIy9mZgQXarx2bvRFI4VnbpxEIBBiO4VnbNVkU"
```

The cyware/ciphey image is hosted on its [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cyware/ciphey).
